# Introduction

This project was created as part of my master's thesis at the Institute for System Software ([SSW](https://ssw.jku.at/))
of the Johannes Kepler University ([JKU](https://www.jku.at/)), located in Linz, Austria.
See the [thesis paper](A_Profiler_for_Java_Programs.pdf) for further details.

The profiler instruments source code directly (as opposed to commonly used bytecode instrumentation)
by inserting counter-statements at the beginning of every executable code block.
<br/>
Blocks are found by parsing files with a recursive descent Scanner+Parser generated by the [Coco/R](https://ssw.jku.at/Research/Projects/Coco/) tool.

The intention for the attributed Grammar (ATG), used in this project, was to be kept of minimal size
and complexity by applying "fuzzy" parsing. This should improve maintainability with the constantly
updating and growing [Java Language Specification](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/index.html).

The five main stages of the profiler are:

In the default mode, this tool will parse and instrument source files automatically, compile them,
run the program (with arguments), and generate an HTML report.

The report provides a structured and sorted overview over the most frequently invoked methods
and other useful metrics for each class.
It further allows detailed exploration of source files and shows coverage (with counts) of grouped statements regions.

The profiler was designed to be a command line tool that can easily be used in scripts, CI/CD pipelines, and automation.

For Java/programming beginners or users who are less familiar with the command line,
a JavaFX tool-runner GUI was created (see [FxUI](#fxui) section).

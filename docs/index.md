# Introduction

This profiler instruments source code directly (as opposed to commonly used bytecode instrumentation)
by inserting counter-statements at the beginning of every executable code block.

It can be used to quickly identify hotspots in a Java program and to measure code coverage.

The profiler was designed to be a command line tool that can easily be used in scripts, CI/CD pipelines, and automation.

Blocks are found by parsing Java files with a recursive descent Scanner and Parser generated by the [Coco/R](https://ssw.jku.at/Research/Projects/Coco/) 
tool using an attributed grammar (ATG).

The ATG is tailored to the use-case of finding code blocks in a "fuzzy" way (using the Coco/R `ANY` wildcard token to 
over-read irrelevant code tokens). This allows the grammar to be of minimal size and complexity and improves 
maintainability against the constantly updating and growing [Java Language Specification](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/index.html).

The five main stages of the profiler are:

In the default mode, this tool will parse and instrument source files automatically, compile them,
run the program (with arguments), and generate an HTML report.

The report provides a structured and sorted overview over the most frequently invoked methods
and other useful metrics for each class.
It further allows detailed exploration of source files and shows coverage (with counts) of grouped statements regions.

For Java/programming beginners or users who are less familiar with the command line,
a JavaFX tool-runner GUI was created (see [FxUI](fxui.md) section).
